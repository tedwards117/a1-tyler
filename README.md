Part 1: Organize your project files

1. On your computer 'Documents' folder, create a new folder called 'GitHub'

Part 2: Clone the repo

1. Clone this repository using GitHub Desktop ** Important: point the local path to the local RWU/Comsc230/Assignments folder
2. Open in VS Code, look at the files in the project, you should see the README and in the 'src' folder two html files
3. Open each of the html files using Google Chrome browser
File/Open/Documents/GitHub/RWU/Comsc230/Assignments/Comsc230-Assignment1-HTML/src/a1-hello-v1.html
4. Open Chrome developer tools: View/Developer/Developer Tools

Part 3: Create a new web page

1. Navigate to https://www.w3schools.com/html/ and look at the first HTML example.
2. Create a new file in the project 'src' folder called: a1-w3schools-example1.html

Part 4: Point the project origin to your github account
